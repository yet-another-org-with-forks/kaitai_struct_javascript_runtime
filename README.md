This library implements Kaitai Struct API for JavaScript.

Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used for describe various binary
data structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary file
formats, network stream packet formats, etc.

## Development

After cloning this repository, you must run these commands to compile the
TypeScript source file [`KaitaiStream.ts`](src/KaitaiStream.ts) into the
`KaitaiStream.js` file (ignored by Git) with JavaScript code:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

`npm run build` also needs to be run after each change to
[`KaitaiStream.ts`](src/KaitaiStream.ts).
